## The Problem This Solves

Applying for jobs often feels like sending your resume into a black box. You don't know why you get rejected or what you could have done better. This tool demystifies the process by providing **data-driven feedback**, showing you exactly where your resume aligns with a job's requirements and where it falls short.

## ‚ú® Core Features

* üìÑ **Dynamic Resume Parsing**: Ingests and understands your resume in PDF format.
* ü§ñ **AI-Powered Gap Analysis**: Intelligently structures job descriptions and compares them against your resume to identify key missing skills and experience.
* üí° **Actionable Optimization**: Provides a clear breakdown of matching qualifications, gaps, and an estimated match score to help you tailor your application effectively.

1.  **Resume Ingestion**: The resume PDF is loaded and parsed. It's then split into semantic chunks, embedded into vectors using Google's models, and stored in a **FAISS** vector database. This creates a searchable knowledge base of the user's experience.
2.  **Job Description Structuring**: A raw job description is passed to an LLM (Gemini) which extracts key information (`required_skills`, `responsibilities`, etc.) into a structured JSON format.
3.  **RAG Analysis**: A **Multi-Query Retriever** uses the structured job data to generate multiple, precise questions to query the resume vector store. The retrieved results are synthesized to produce the final, detailed comparison report.
